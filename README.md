# Style guide
Usually we would do `snake_case` everywhere as Lord intended. Unfortunately Go wants us to use capital letters to mark  
public variables/functions. Silly.  
```go
PascalCase // for public functions and variables
WHATEVER_THIS_IS // for public consts
snake_case // for anything else
```
# Two idiots one terminal
Row and Col start from 1 -> so that was a small shot in the knee

Any company or individual shall be publicly shamed for breaking current license.
